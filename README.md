Communication guide to working with Marie.

## What do you want us to know about your communciation style?

- I am visual learner and master concepts by repeating them. When I'm not sure of the next time i'll need to repeat a task, I write down my process for future reference. 
- I enjoy expressing to others that their wants and needs are my priority.  
- I am a big fan of verbal expressions of encouragement and appreciation.
- I am a connector as in i'm always searching to connect people to and to see how my past experiences connect with new situations.

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?

- I must have tasks/assignments written down so if you're asking, i'm storing the thought somewhere in writting or i'm likely going to forget it. 
- I use Slack for short quick communication, not as a place to store information or have an important conversations.
- I am an extrovert, love face-to-face interaction and am very animated in person. Book some facetime with me!
- I get excited about helping people get what they need.

## How can you best work with me?

- Be as clear and detailed about what you are asking for and communicate timeline/urgency.
- If I haven't done something you've asked for, it's likely due to one of three things: a roadblock, misunderstanding of the task or urgency. Let's chat about which one it is.
- I need frequent check-ins with managers (once weekly preffered). 
- Provide constructive feedback often and without restraint.
- Tell me about your life outside of work so we can connect on a personal level. 
- Tell me the things that are less pleasnt in your day-to-day routine so I can take some of them off of your plate. 

## What are your pet peeves?

- That's not my job, therefore I'm not going to do it.
- Not claiming responsibility for your mistakes and shortcomings.
- Scope creep.

## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?

- I usually assume that I am one of the least intelligent person in the room, sometimes that helps me in situations where I feel like questions are encouraged, other times it makes me avoid human interaction.
- I don't understand sarcasm. 
- I care about what other people think of me. 
- I have a fear of being called out for not knowing what I am doing, in the middle of trying to fiugre out what i'm doing.
- I often need to repeat something several times to get to the point where I want to optimize the process. 
- I like to take my time understanding context before taking action.
